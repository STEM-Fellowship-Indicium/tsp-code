## Making changes

### Before
Before you start editing, make sure you're on the main branch and that you're on the latest version! Run `git pull` to pull all changes before making new ones!

### Creating a new branch
If you're making changes to this repo, copy/paste the following commands when you're making your **first** commit:
```
git checkout -b "your-name/feature"
git add .
git commit -m "New Feature"
git push --set-upstream origin "your-name/feature"
git checkout main
```

REPLACE `your-name/feature` with your name and the feature you're adding! If it's not your first commit, use `git push` rather than `git push --set-upstream origin your-name/feature`

Then head over to the GitHub repo online and create a pull request from the branch you just created.

After the first commit, you don't need to copy/paste the above again, you can make commits as usual.
